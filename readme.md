# The MemGame

Welcome to the memory game.

React for front-end

Fastify for back-end

## Build

### Development

Process/terminal #1

```bash
cd client
yarn
yarn start
```

Process/terminal #2

```bash
cd server
yarn
yarn start
```

### Production

```bash
cd client
yarn --production
yarn build

cd ../server
yarn --production
yarn build
yarn start:prod
```

### Notes

I'm fairly new to Typescript and have only recently used it by migrating one of my projects back-end to use Typescript. Thats also why I decided not to use it for the client.
